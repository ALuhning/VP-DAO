## PORTING MOLOCH DAO V2 TO NEAR FOR INTEGRATION IN DECENTRALIZED COMMUNITIES
----

Communities may require the ability to coordinate funds and resources.  As an example, let's consider how guilds interact in the NEAR Guilds community.  Each guild has the option of submitting proposals to the community for funding consideration.  

One option to deciding whether to fund the proposal is to have a human committee sit around and discuss each proposal and then arbitrarily or based on some set criteria decide to award the funding from the resource pool.

A better option considering we are interested in web 3.0 technologies is to provide a module that facilitates coordination and resource allocation through a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).  This project ported Moloch v2 to run on NEAR and it could be the start of the answer.

For this project, we needed a currency we could freely transfer around so we deployed a NEP-21 fungible token to NEAR (Vital Point Coin (VPC) using VP Guild's Fungible Token Module.  Moloch DAO allows multiple tokens to be used, so we could create multiple tokens and use them all, but for the purposes of this demo/project, we're limiting it to VPC.

The video below doesn't cover every aspect of the Moloch DAO, but it will give you a good overview.  The port is not 100% complete yet (still need to hook up ragequit, guildkick and sort out some gas issues) but it's nearing MVP for member and funding proposals.  Next steps will see some interface work to make it more intuitive/usable.
